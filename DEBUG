/* Solution as follows */

INSERT INTO employee (Id,Name,Age,Address)

/* Code had the following 2 errors
- Column 1 was the primary key - hence it must be unique
- Column 4 has constraints of 'unique' varchar - hence no entries can be duplicate*/
VALUES  (1, 'John Smith', 25,  '123 Main St'),
        (2, 'Sarah Johnson', 30,'456 Broadway'),
        (3, 'Michael Brown', 45,  '123 BroadwaySt'),
        (4, 'Jessica Davis', 28,  '321 Elm St');
